Hello ðŸ‘‹! My name is FlÃ¡vio Silva and I'm currently finishing Master's degree in Electrotechnical and Computer Engineering, specialized in Microelectronics and Embedded Systems. I'm curious by nature, so IÂ´ve tried to maximize my knowledge in my academic path, doing minors in Automotive Electronics and Quality and Reliability Systems. My masters thesis, titled 'Monitoring and control system for a beverage extraction machine', was about improving energy effiency of an industrial beverage extraction machine.
My areas of expertise are:
- Embedded Systems;
- Distributed Systems;
- RTOS;
- Lean, six sigma, kaizen, just-in-time management models/philosofies;
- Automotive electronics;
- Industrial machines control;
- PCB/Semiconductors design;
- Programming (C, python, Java, Matlab);

This repository will be used to expose my academic projects... the ones I consider relevant or that I'm proud of. I'll start by highlighting:
- 'Monitoring and control system for a beverage extraction machine' - the main goal was to develop a monitoring system for a beverage extraction machine, and controling it in a way that would improve energy comsuption;
- 'Optimized aquaculture' - the main goal was to develop a product to improve productivity in aquaculture tanks;
- 'MovieFinder' - an Android app for finding movies and their information, as well as getting movie suggestions based on a user's profile
